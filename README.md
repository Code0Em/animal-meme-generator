# Bark vs. Meow: The Battle for the Couch

## Description

Bark vs. Meow is a fun meme generator which provides people a fun way to create cat or dog based memes in their web browser.

This project fullfils the criteria of building a a performant and scalable front-end single-page (React) application that fulfills a real-world need, with a focus on data and user demand. It features a clean and responsive user interface and utilises HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Node.js.

Bark vs. Meow makes use of two APIs which provide images and associated breed information to the application: TheCatAPI (https://thecatapi.com) and TheDogAPI (https://www.thedogapi.com).

Bark vs. Meow runs in the browser and allows users to generate a new meme via a button depending on their preference: a cat or a dog. The associated API is then called and returns an image along with associated breed information. The user can then populate the meme with any text of their choice.

Once a meme has been completed by the user, they can save their meme locally (to the browser) and later retrieve it by clicking on the image on the page.

Bark vs. Meow has an aesthetically pleasing and accessible user interface which utilises Bootstrap as well as taking into account accessibility concerns such as utilising an accessible colour scheme, semantic HTML, alt attributes and ARIA labels.
